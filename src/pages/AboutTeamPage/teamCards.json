I was so exited about opportunities and results in coding, so i even decide to make my own interactive strategy game. I spend much time trying to bring my ideas with realizing this project and this was very fun. But it was a long time ago… Today i feel that it was some sort of signal, so i decide to improve my skills and change my life. I believe, that becoming knowledge in web-design, programming languages, and developer stuff can help me to realize my ideas in future projects.",
